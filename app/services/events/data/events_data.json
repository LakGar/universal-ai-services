    "longDescription": "Universal AI Services convenes a three-month evening series in collaboration with the Harvard Club of San Francisco and the MIT Club of Northern California examining how artificial intelligence is increasingly embedded in the physical world and the industries that operate within it. The series takes place in San Francisco from 6:00 to 9:00 PM, with doors opening at 5:30 PM. Each program brings together researchers, technologists, practitioners, and industry leaders to explore the evolving relationship between AI systems, physical environments, and real-world deployment.\n\n**February 17 - Entertainment, Music, and Media**\n\nThe opening event examines how AI is reshaping entertainment, music, and film across both digital and physical contexts. As AI tools influence creative production, performance, and distribution, and as embodied systems enter studios, stages, and public spaces, this program considers the implications of intelligent technologies for cultural expression and audience experience. Topics include AI-assisted music and film production, immersive and interactive media, humanoid performers, and robotics in live and experiential settings.\n\n**March 11 - Physical AI**\n\nThe second event focuses on the technical foundations of AI systems that perceive, move, and act in the physical world. Discussions address advances in robotics, sensing, foundation models, autonomy, and edge intelligence, with particular attention to real-world perception, safety, and deployment beyond simulation. The program emphasizes both the opportunities and the limitations of current approaches to embodied intelligence.\n\n**April 16 - Construction and Real Estate**\n\nThe final event turns to the built environment, examining how AI is influencing construction and real estate through a combination of robotics and software. Topics include robotic labor, autonomous site inspection, AI-supported planning and simulation, development intelligence, and property analytics. The discussion considers how these technologies are reshaping design, construction workflows, and long-term management of buildings and urban systems.\n\nThrough this series, Universal AI Services facilitates dialogue across academic, technical, and industry communities, creating a shared space for careful examination of how AI is moving from research settings into everyday environments.",
